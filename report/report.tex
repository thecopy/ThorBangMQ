    A little explanation of how the report is structured.

    \section{Implementation description}
        TODO: make \& insert graphs

        \subsection{Client}
        \subsection{Middleware}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Resource pooling (locks vs. overhead of setting up new connections/spawning new threads)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Database connections
                    \item Worker threads
                \end{itemize}
                \item Non-blocking sockets (all network i/o in main thread vs. overhead of spawning new threads, conceptually easier to implement all i/o in main thread vs. doing it in worker threads)
            \end{itemize}
        \subsection{Database}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Indexes
                \item Choice of schema (replicating messages vs. using relation table)
                \item Using direct SQL calls (size of direct SQL text vs. size of text using stored procedures)
            \end{itemize}

    \section{Testing infrastructure}

    \section{Tests}
        TODO: Introductory comments.\\
        \\
        We used DigitalOcean.\\
        \\
        We have identified these variables which we modify when testing the performance of our system.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Client
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Number of clients per server
                \item Total number of clients
                \item Actual test performed
            \end{itemize}
            \item Middleware
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Database connections
                \item Worker threads
                \item Impact of using database (vs. not storing messages ['haha, I fooled you'])
            \end{itemize}
            \item Database
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Pure send message}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item NOTE: we know that the amount of messages is going up (that we are varying more variables simultaneously).
                \item Find point where system thrashes
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Pure create queue}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item NOTE: we know that the amount of queues is going up (that we are varying more variables simultaneously).
                \item Find point where system thrashes
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Pure pop}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item NOTE: we know that the amount of messages is going down (that we are varying more variables simultaneously). We expect to see the time for each pop to fall.
            \item Find point where system thrashes
        \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Pure peek}

        \subsection{Mixed requests}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Simulation of 'real workload'?
            \end{itemize}

        \subsection{Database connections vs. worker threads}
            This is a $2^2$ test.

        \subsection{Number of messages connections vs. time of reads}
            This is a $2^2$ test.

        \subsection{TODO: More tests}

    \section{Results}
    TODO: Note that we're using a closed system which has an effect on the system
        TODO: Show raw data, graphs, do statistical treatment of data

    \section{Analysis}

    \section{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Say something about performance of system
            \item What we could've done different
        \end{itemize}
